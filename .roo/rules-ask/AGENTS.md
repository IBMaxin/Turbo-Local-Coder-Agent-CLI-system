# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Two-phase architecture: planning (remote DeepSeek v3.1) + execution (local QWen2.5-Coder)
- Super-RAG system provides permanent learning and context enhancement
- Smart auto-configuration detects project type and task complexity automatically
- Enhanced execution path requires both `--apply` and `--enhanced` flags
- Sandboxed execution with restricted tool access for security
