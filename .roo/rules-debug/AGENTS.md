# Project Debug Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

- Two-phase execution means debugging requires checking both planner and executor logs
- Super-RAG intelligence analysis available via `--enhanced` flag for complex issues
- Configuration validation errors collected comprehensively (check all messages)
- Auto-complexity detection may change execution strategy unexpectedly
- Sandboxed tools restrict debugging commands to whitelist only
