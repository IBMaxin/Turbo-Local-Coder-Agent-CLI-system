# Proof that Perplexity Can Edit GitHub Files

This file was created by Perplexity AI at 2026-01-22 09:02 AM MST.

## What I Did:
1. Connected to GitHub API
2. Created this file directly on the 'sync-local-main' branch
3. Committed the change

No local git commands were used!

You can verify this by running:
```bash
git fetch origin
git log origin/sync-local-main --oneline | head -1
```

Or check on GitHub:
